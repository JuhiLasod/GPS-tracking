This web application is designed to transmit a user's current geographical location to a specified email address. It leverages the browser's Geolocation API, accessed through the React framework, to obtain real-time location data. Upon submission, the application sends an email containing a direct link to the user's location on Google Maps, enabling the recipient to view the exact position of the individual requesting assistance.

Looking ahead, this platform could evolve into a comprehensive SOS emergency alert system. Future enhancements may include the ability to automatically dispatch the user's current location to a predefined list of emergency contacts or email addresses stored in the database at the time of user registration. Users would also have the flexibility to update this contact list as needed. Additionally, a key objective for future development is enabling real-time tracking of a userâ€™s live location, rather than sending a one-time snapshot, to provide continuous support in emergency scenarios.
